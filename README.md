Use Bing's Image of the Day as your desktop wallpaper(Windows, Linux)

Right now this thing only works on Windows and is CUI only. I later want to add a tray menu icon that lets you change the image region(currently its the US) as well as make it work on  Linux


Found a bug?(Highly likely) Tell me about it!
